* There are four kinds of objects: "Baba" (the white rabbit), "Wall", "Rock", "Flag",
and five different blocks of attributes: "You", "Push", "Defeat", "Stop", "Win", and connecting block "Is."
* Objects can be connected with the five attributes "You", "Push", "Defeat", "Stop", "Win", with "Is" in the middle, by moving an object, "Is", an attribute, in a line. For example, if "Wall" "is" "You" are put into a line, the player is controlling Wall(s) using the arrow keys on their keyboard. "Push" make objects movable, "Stop" makes objects impassable, "Win" specifies the objects that if you touch it you will win the game. 
* The home page of the game is the Menu Mode, which contains "Start" "Demo" "Help" "Credit" buttons that link to specific modes when players click on them. 
"Start" links to the Level Mode, showing four levels of the game with increasing difficulty
"Demo" links to Level 0 to help players get an idea of the game
"Help" links to Instruction Mode with rules on it
"Credit" links to the page with pictures and names of the developers.
