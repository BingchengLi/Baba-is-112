:3rd_place_medal:Third place in Hack112, a 24-hour hackathon organized by Carnegie Mellon University.

## Rules
- There are four kinds of objects: `Baba` (the white rabbit), `Wall`, `Rock`, `Flag`, and five different blocks of attributes: `You`, `Push`, `Defeat`, `Stop`, `Win`, and connecting block `Is`.
- Objects can be connected with the five attributes `You`, `Push`, `Defeat`, `Stop`, `Win` with `Is` in the middle, by moving an object, `Is`, an attribute, in a line. For example, if `Wall` `is` `You` are put into a line, the player is controlling Wall(s) using the arrow keys on their keyboard. `Push` make objects movable, `Stop` makes objects impassable, `Win` specifies the objects that if you touch it you will win the game. 
- The home page of the game is the Menu Mode, which contains `Start` `Demo` `Help` `Credit` buttons that link to specific modes when players click on them. 
  - `Start` links to the Level Mode, showing four levels of the game with increasing difficulty
  - `Demo` links to Level 0 to help players get an idea of the game
  - `Help` links to Instruction Mode with rules on it
  - `Credit` links to the page with pictures and names of the developers.
